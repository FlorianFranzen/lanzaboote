ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ **This is not working yet. Come back later.** ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

This repository contains experimental tooling for Secure Boot on
[NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

Remaining high-level things to do:

- Document a experimental setup for developers on how to use this repository
- Coordinate with bootspec RFC stakeholders to communicate a experience report on the bootspec usage ;
- Upstream as much as possible things: Rust unstable things on a stable compiler (?), etc. ;
- Unit testing for `lanzatool` ;
- Investigating how this can fit into systemd-boot theory about sysexts for initrds while keeping NixOS semantics ;
- Threat modelling explanations: "bring your own PKI", "share your PKI with MSFT CA", "bring rhboot shim with MOK", etc. ;
- Ensuring 99 % of the paths are "happy paths" : protecting user against bricking their machines, identifying sources of risk, communicating intent and detecting risks ;
- Experimenting with `fwupd`
- Experimenting with TPM2 measurements
- Studying the initrd secrets feature in NixOS wrt SecureBoot & TPM2

## lanzatool

`lanzatool` is a Linux command line application that takes a
[bootspec](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/125) document and
installs the boot files into the UEFI
[ESP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition).


To make systemd-boot recognize a new boot target, `lanzatool` builds a
[UKI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_kernel_image) image. To
avoid having to embed kernel and initrd, we use a custom stub
`lanzaboote` (see below) that loads kernel and initrd from the ESP.

Remaining items to implement are:

- Migrations from non-SecureBoot machine (old generation files) ;
- Alternative Nix stores paths ;
- Key rotation support ;
- Bootspec (abuse) cleanups ;
- Automatic synchronization policies for changing PKI (rotating keys, re-enrolling them, etc.) ;
- NixOS specialisations support ;
- Automatic removal of unused files relative to the `configurationLimit` option ;
- `os-release` patch so `systemd-boot` shows pretty names with generation number

## lanzaboote

`lanzaboote` is the stub that `lanzatool` uses to form an UKI. It
loads a Linux kernel and initrd without breaking the Secure Boot chain
of trust. Instead of rolling our own crypto, `lanzaboote` re-uses the
signature verification that is built-in to UEFI.

Remaining items to implement are:

- TPM measurements like `systemd-stub` does
- Better error management

## Relevant Nixpkgs Work

This project depends on upstream nixpkgs work:
